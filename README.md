# IRIS: AI for Primary Care

**Smarter care. Earlier action. Better outcomes.**

IRIS is a modular, AI-powered risk prediction system built for the messy, multimorbid reality of primary care. We combine structured EHR data with patient-reported outcomes (PROs) to surface actionable insights — not just predictions.

### 🧠 What Makes IRIS Different?

- **Built for Frontline Care**  
  Unlike traditional risk models designed for population health analysts, IRIS is optimized for in-clinic use — real-time, interpretable, and embedded into clinical workflows.

- **Multimorbidity-Aware Modeling**  
  We go beyond single-disease prediction to capture complex, compounding risks in aging and underserved populations.

- **Explainable by Design**  
  Transparent SHAP-backed explainability, fairness metrics, and metadata layers help support clinical trust and regulatory readiness.

### ⚙️ Real Use, Real Impact

IRIS is in active development using a dual-source strategy: model training leverages large-scale EHR data from over 20 million patients, while clinical workflows and patient-reported outcome integration is co-developed with a network of independent primary care clinics. This approach allows us to model complexity at population scale, while ensuring usability, transparency, and trust are informed by the realities of frontline care. IRIS is built for more than just benchmark performance — we’re focused on clinical relevance, transparency, and real-world adoption.
### 🛠️ Current Modules

- **Risk Explorer** – Customizable patient-level risk explorer with explainability overlays  
- **Model Transparency Layer** – Model cards, data provenance, and fairness auditing  
- **Clinician Feedback Loop** – Designed for co-design with PCPs, not black-box handoffs
